## Writeup

At the beginning of the video, we can see a quote of Linus Sebastian from the WAN Show. Given that the video was uploaded in 23 Jan 2022, we are sure that the quote is from an episode before that time.

Downloading the transcripts of the most recent 5 episodes of WAN Show from YouTube, and search for the line (searching for “rabbit hole” alone is enough). We can locate the video and timestamp when this was said.

At this part of the show, Linus was talking about YouTube Vanced, which is a hint.

Watch the video with YouTube Vanced, (or discover that SponsorBlock is a major feature of the app, then watch the video with the SponsorBlock browser plugin installed), we can see that the videos have some of the segments skipped automatically.

Concatenating all segments not skipped, we can see the flag.
