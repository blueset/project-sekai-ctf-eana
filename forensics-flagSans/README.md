# flag Sans

Inspect the font file, we can see that it has OpenType Stylistic Sets enabled.

Peeking into its definitions, we can see that each Stylistic set converts the word `flag` into a part of the actual flag.
Install the font, type `flag` and then enable the Stylistic Sets one by one to get the full flag.
