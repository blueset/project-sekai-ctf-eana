# Fast hands

Someday in the SEKAI Public Library, you saw two guys talking to each other at the desk across the corridor. They didn’t speak a word, but their hands was just moving so fast. You were so curious what’s going on. After they’ve left, you found this piece of paper on the desk.

Can you figure out what’s going on?

## Writeup

The title suggest stenography (not to confuse with ste*ga*nography). The curves are shorthands, and the letters are stenotypes, both in English. The names at the beginning hints the standards used. `Gregg49` is the Gregg Shorthand Simplified edition published in 1949, `Plover18` is the Plover stenotype dictionary published in 2018.
Matching the words against their respective dictionaries, we can get the following conversation:

> - hello
> - hi
> - ready for the flag?
> - yes of course
> - it starts with **S E K A I in all caps**
> - followed by an **open curly bracket**
> - and the word **how with a capitalized H** followed by **an underscore**
> - then write **fast where the second letter is in uppercase** after which is **an underbar**
> - and then the word **can with capitalized N** followed by **an underscore**
> - after that comes **uppercase U** and **underbar**
> - next is the word **write but replace the letter i with number one**
> - jot down **an ampersand** and then the word **type but change the last letter to three**
> - finally close with a **curly bracket**
> - is it all good?
> - awesome!
